# MetaMind: Automated Network Meta-Analysis Framework

This repository contains author-generated code supporting the study:

**MetaMind: A Multi-Agent Transformer-Driven Framework for Automated Network Meta-Analyses**  
Livieratos et al., PLOS ONE (accepted)

## Overview
The code implements the core components of the MetaMind framework, including:
- Literature retrieval using Promptriever
- Multi-agent large language model extraction workflows
- Prompt templates used for structured clinical data extraction
- Automated generation and execution of Bayesian network meta-analyses

## Contents
- Retrieval scripts for identifying relevant clinical trials
- Prompt templates used across pipeline stages
- Extraction and aggregation logic
- Analysis scripts for Bayesian NMA

## Reproducibility
This code relies on third-party large language model APIs and external software packages.
Users must supply their own API credentials to reproduce the workflow.

Proprietary model weights, API keys, and paid datasets are not included.
